      <p>
        You&apos;ve reached the end of the form! You should get an email
        confirmation. Make sure that you have received it so that you can double
        check your responses. I will also be responding to the same mailbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;ll get back to you in 3 days (max). If you don&apos;t hear back
        from me in 3 days time, feel free to poke me or re-send your booking
        form. I may have missed it. I do be best to reply even if I am just
        letting you know that I am not the right artist for you. That way
        you&apos;re not left waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        That being said, if you&apos;ve changed your mind after I replied,
        please let me know you&apos;re no longer interested so I&apos;m not left
        waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you ever need to cancel a tattoo appointment, please let me know as
        well! I swear I won&apos;t hold it against you. I rather be told than
        have a no-show where I&apos;m wondering where you are.
      </p>
      <p>Looking forward to conversing with you. Have a great day.</p>
